People often get into this\nsituation by installing esbuild with npm running inside of Rosetta 2 and then\ntrying to use it with node running outside of Rosetta 2, or vice versa (Rosetta\n2 is Apple's on-the-fly x86_64-to-arm64 translation service).\n\nIf you are installing with npm, you can try ensuring that both npm and node are\nnot running under Rosetta 2 and then reinstalling esbuild. This likely involves\nchanging how you installed npm and/or node. For example, installing node with\nthe universal installer here should work: https://nodejs.org/en/download/. Or\nyou could consider using yarn instead of npm which has built-in support for\ninstalling a package on multiple platforms simultaneously.\n\nIf you are installing with yarn, you can try listing both \"arm64\" and \"x64\"\nin your \".yarnrc.yml\" file using the \"supportedArchitectures\" feature:\nhttps://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc/#supportedArchitectures\nKeep in mind that this means multiple copies of esbuild will be present.\n\nAnother alternative is to use the \"esbuild-wasm\" package instead, which works\nthe same way on all platforms. But it comes with a heavy performance cost and\ncan sometimes be 10x slower than the \"esbuild\" package, so you may also not\nwant to do that.\n\n    at generateBinPath ($SNIP/.npm/_npx/bc7e1e37fcb46ffc/node_modules/esbuild/lib/main.js:1910:17)\n    at esbuildCommandAndArgs ($SNIP/.npm/_npx/bc7e1e37fcb46ffc/node_modules/esbuild/lib/main.js:1991:33)\n    at ensureServiceIsRunning ($SNIP/.npm/_npx/bc7e1e37fcb46ffc/node_modules/esbuild/lib/main.js:2163:25)\n    at startSyncServiceWorker ($SNIP/.npm/_npx/bc7e1e37fcb46ffc/node_modules/esbuild/lib/main.js:2378:19)\n    at Object.<anonymous> ($SNIP/.npm/_npx/bc7e1e37fcb46ffc/node_modules/esbuild/lib/main.js:2419:3)\n    at Module._compile (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1254:14)\n    at Module._extensions..js (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1308:10)\n    at Module.load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1117:32)\n    at Module._load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:958:12)\n    at Function.executeUserEntryPoint [as runMain] (node:internal/modules/run_main:81:12)"},"context":{"inCI":false,"isTTY":true,"platform":"macOS","cliVersion":"8.0.5"}},"timestamp":1711957036210}},"type":"Object","created":"2024-04-01T07:37:16.210Z","ttl":0}
